# galaxy-collision-simulator
This project demonstrates the collision of two galaxies and simulates the gravitational interaction between two spiral galaxies. Each star is modelled as a particle influenced by Newtonian gravity and the galactic cores include the Plummer-sphere dark matter halos for real world demonstration. Change in parameters can account for real world values.
